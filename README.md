# Airline-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning

This project looks to identify what insights can be drawn from the public's sentiment towards 6 different US airlines.

Modelling:
- Do you notice anything about the data from exploratory analysis?
- Can you form a ‘baseline to beat’ by training a simple, naive model to begin with?
- How would neural networks perform vs non-neural network models?
- How well can pre-trained models perform on the dataset?
- When selecting a model in a business environment, what factors would you consider apart from predictive performance (e.g. accuracy)?

Insights:
- What are the key predictors of your model that are most important in the model’s classification?
- What were the challenges? Are there any caveats or risks with interpreting outputs?
- What can we understand about sentiment towards airlines?
- What technical next steps would you suggest if this was to be continued?
- What business next steps would you suggest based on current findings?
